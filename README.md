## Project 1: K-hop Reachability

K-hop Reachability is a generalized reachability problem. It extends the meaning of reachability and provides more specific query for reachability problems.

## Project 2: Dynamic Update for Weighted Near MIS

This project is a toy model for Dynamic Update of Weighted Near MIS. We took advantage of Dependency Graph in the work of [*Computing A Near-Maximum Independent Set In Dynamic Graphs*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8731405) to try to solve the above problem. But it turns out to be too complicated.

## Project 3: SimRank Enhanced by Semantic

SimRank is a well-known method for similarity query, nowadays with more specific query comes into our sight, the Semantic-enhanced SimRank is a more and more heated topic. In this project we combined two glamorous work of SimRank & Semantic.
